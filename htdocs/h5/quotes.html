<blockquote cite="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jul/09/defamation-bill-scientific-free-speech">[Plaintiffs] cannot, by simply filing suit and crying 'character assassination!', silence those who hold divergent views, no matter how adverse those views may be to plaintiffs' interests. Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation … More papers, more discussion, better data, and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us.</blockquote>
<cite>Judge Easterbrook from a 1994 American libel action over a scientific controversy</cite>

<blockquote cite="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0gAcbAGPH4">I would love to have the faith to believe that [the creation] took place in seven days, but &hellip; I have thoughts &hellip; and that can really fuck up the faith thing. Just ask any Catholic priest.</blockquote>
