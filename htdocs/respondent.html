<h1>Preliminary response to Petition of <br />
Maria Elizabeth Mitchell</h1>

<div id="AN">

	<p class="petitioner">Attendance note 09.10.09</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr Mitchell works as an Advertising Executive for EHS Brann, London.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mrs Mitchell instructs that Mr Mitchell is aggressive, argumentative and confrontational as well as being moody and resentful.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mrs Mitchell does not get along with Mr Mitchell's family and so she chooses not to participate in family gatherings as she does not feel accepted by them.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr Mitchell does not seem to understand her position or show her any support in relation to this situation. He also does not see any problem with his family failing to offer any support with childcare or even sending Mrs Mitchell birthday cards. Mrs Mitchell does not have any close family in the area and so she feels alone at times.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">There is also a 12 year age gap between the parties and Mrs Mitchell does not feel that they are equal to each other in the decision making process. Mr Mitchell refuses to listen to Mrs Mitchell's ideas preferring to be in control.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr Mitchell is very controlling over finances and very secretive about his financial position. Mr Mitchell only allows the client limited spending from the join account. In reality Mrs Mitchell inherited some money and paid it into the joint account. Some of this money was used to discharge the mortgage with Mrs Mitchell's knowledge, although not subject to any discussion with her, but the remainder was transferred from the joint account and the joint account closed by Mr Mitchell without Mrs Mitchell's knowledge. Mr Mitchell makes no contribution to the running of the household and Mrs Mitchell has furnished the entire property herself.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr Mitchell is always saying that Mrs Mitchell has kept him poor by booking holidays she cannot afford, but he makes no contribution to those holidays. For example he took only &pound;100 towards spending money on the last family holiday and expected Mrs Mitchell to fund the remainder.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr and Mrs Mitchell have not engaged in an intimate relationship for some time.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Conor:
	Mrs Mitchell is responsible for paying the transportation costs for C which amount to about &pound;1,000 pa.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">In relation to contact Mrs M would like to be as flexible as possible given C's age and Mrs M has no objection to him having a good relationship with his father. At present as both parties are sharing the accommodation C spends time with his father in the home.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">In relation to fin. matters, Mrs M earns c. &pound;500 net p.m. and receives &pound;80 child benefits. Her working tax and child tax credit has been calculated based on Mr Mitchell's circumstances. She receives &pound;45 p.m. Mrs M has some Tesco's shares as part of the share scheme whereby a number of shares can only be released for sale after a certain amount of time. Mrs Mitchell drives an 05 reg Yaris and has approx &pound;2000 of credit card debt. </p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mr M earns around &pound;34,000 pa or &pound;2000 pm net. Mrs M believes he possibly has a pension fund, but is uncertain. She believes that Mr M will have savings in the region of &pound;5000 to &pound;6000 but she is not entirely sure. As she knows very little about his financial circumstances it is also possible that he has endowment policies and premium bonds. He drives an 08 reg Yaris and has no debt.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">The matrimonial home is owned in the joint names of both parties subject to a mortgage with either the Nationwide or the Halifax of around &pound;60000. Mrs Mitchell estimates the property to be worth in the region of &pound;250000. In 2005 Mrs M inherited money and paid &pound;60000 off the mortgage. She paid an additional &pound;17000 on a conservatory for the property and gave Mr M &pound;15000 for a car. Mr Mitchell currently pays the mortgage which is around &pound;300 pm. Mrs Mitchell initially instructed that she would like to try and stay in the house for the sake of her son.</p>

</div>

<div id="Advice">
	
	<p class="petitioner"></p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">ADVICE </p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Divorce</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">approx 6 months.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Needs to be irretrievable breakdown together with (eg) unreasonable behaviour.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Given Mr M's behaviour it is more than likely possible for you to obtain a divorce on unreasonable behaviour. Such a divorce does not require Mr Mitchell to make any admission of guilt or even to consent to the proceedings.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">In relation to financial matters this is much more difficult for me to say exactly how your financial situation will resolve itself as I do not have full knowledge of Mr Mitchell's financial position. Essentially however the starting point will be 50/50 with consideration being given to the contributions made to the property by yourself in relation to the inheritance monies and the conservatory as well as the fact y ou will be the primary carer of Conor. You could secure sufficient monies from the property to enable you to purchase a property for yourself and C. You are in a large property which means you are technically over housed. There is sufficient equity in the property for it to be divided between you both. Mr Mitchell is on a higher salary, considerably higher than Mrs M, and this would also be something taken into consideration when negotiating a financial settlement.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mrs M should make enquiries of a mortgage advisor as to whether or not she would have any mortgage capacity. Mrs Mitchell should also apply for working tax and child tax credit in her own name, given her low income her tax credits are likely to increase. By my calculations Mrs Mitchell would receive, per year, &pound;2.780 child tax credit and working tax credit of &pound;3,750. If Mrs M were to increase her hours to 30 hrs pw or in fact does already work 30 hrs p w with overtime then she would be eligible for an additional &pound;775 tax credits. It must be borne in mind that it is likely that Mrs M's income is over the threshold for maximum tax credits and so her tax credit would be reduced by 39% per year. This works out, on 22 and a half hours per week to &pound;331 per month or on 30 hrs p w to &pound;371 pm. This makes a total income of &pound;1,220 approx. It is likely that Mrs M will have mortgage capacity but she will need to see a financial advisor. Mrs Mitchell shld factor in a deposit of around &pound;90,000. This is based on an equal division of the equity. Mrs M is likely to have more than this. This will give the financial advisor something to work with. Mrs Mitchell should also look at suitable properties in the area for herself and C bearing in mind that she will need to downsize. It may be possible for Mrs Mitchell to have a property free of mortgage or with only a very small mortgage indeed.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Mrs M may be able to offset any claims for spousal maintenance, based on Mr Mitchell's greater income and any claims against any potential pension funds or other savings that Mr Mitchell may have by taking a larger share of the equity in the property.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">If Mrs M is still inclined to remain in the former matrimonial home then she will need to give consideration to purchasing Mr Mitchell's share. This would mean increasing the existing mortgage to be able to buy out his interest. It is likely that Mrs Mitchell will need to take the mortgage up to around &pound;115,000 and she may be unable to secure such a large mortgage given her financial circumstances. This is another thing that she will need to investigate. I have based my calculation on a 70/30 split of the equity in favour of Mrs M.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Until I have a greater idea of any savings or endowments that Mr M my have I cannot factor these into my calculations, nor can I deal with pensions. It may be possible, given the length of the marriage that Mrs M would have a claim agains Mr M's pension fund, but only for the years that they have been together and not in relation to any pension accrued before that date.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">I would advise that mediation is considered in order to obtain full details of Mr Mitchell's financial position and thereafter to try and negotiate a settlement. This is a costs effective way of dealing with financial matters if the parties are able to communicate. In the event mediation is not appropriate then I will ask for full financial disclosure from Mr M and Mrs M of their financial circumstances so that I can give more accurate advice.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">
	Transfer of property</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">If you jointly own a property with your spouse and it is agreed in due course that your spouse should transfer a share in that property to you:</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Any conveyancing work will have to be paid for by you at normal rates and will not be covered by legal aid. There may also be disbursements, such as search fees and Land Registry fees.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Such transfers are normally considered transfers at "under value". This means that you are unlikely to pay to your spouse a lump sum representing the exact value of his share. e.g. in some cases the property can be transferred to you but you, for instance, do not make a claim on some other asset, such as a pension, car or premium bonds. You would, in that case, pay less than half to your spouse for his share.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">The importance of this is that if your spouse should become bankrupt witin 5 years of the transfer, the Trustee in Bankruptcy can, under the Insolvency Act, apply to the court to set aside the Transfer of Property bec. it is at under value. What this means is that in order to retain your property you would have to pay to the T in B the share in the property which your ex would have been entitled to at the point of the transfer. You must therefore take out an indemnity to cover this.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">
	Severance of Joint Tenancy</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Either Joint Tenancy or Tenancy in Common.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Joint tenants - on death of one, share passes to the other.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Tenants in Common - on death of one, share passes as specified in Tenant's will, or laws of intestacy.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">A joint tenancy can be severed, and made tenancy in common.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">
	Contact</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">It is the right of the child to have contact with both parents, and not the right of both parents to have contact with the child.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">A judge will encourage contact with both. The court must consider child's welfare first, then any wishes of the child, and his physical, emotiional and educational needs; the likely effect on him of any change in circumstances; any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering and how capable each parent is of meeting those requirements.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">If an app is made to the court then a Court Welfare Officer is asked to prepare a report, which is designed to assist the judge.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Parental responsibility</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">Residence</p>

<div id="Petition">
	<p class="petitioner"></p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">PETITION:</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">(i) The Petitioner finds the Respondent to be aggressive, argumentative, confrontational, moody and resentful. The Petitioner and Respondent do not agree over many things.</p>

	<p class="respondent">Yes, at times the Respondent has been all these things, in vexation at the Petitioner's reluctance or inability to shift her stance on any point of disagreement between us, and a tendency to develop an unpleasant and intimidating manner if frustrated in her argument. The Respondent regrets his aggressive manner and apologises for it.</p>

	<p class="petitioner">The Petitioner does not get on with the Respondent's family and as a result the Petitioner chooses not to participate in family gatherings. The Petitioner has never been made to feel accepted by the Respondent's family. They have little to do with the Petitioner or Conor to the extent where they do not even send the Petitioner a birthday card.</p>

	<p class="respondent">Apart from one remark by one of the Respondent's sisters very early in the marriage, the Respondent's family has always been accepting of and welcoming to the Petitioner. At no time has the Petitioner ever had an argument or uncivil exchange with any member of the Respondent's family, nor apart from the said remark has any member of the Respondent's family ever been unfriendly, uncivil, unwelcoming or hostile to the Petitioner. The Petitioner is welcome even now at the home of any member of the Respondent's family, and members of the Respondent's family have been neither judgemental nor unwilling in their acceptance of the Petitioner. The Petitioner has complained that the Respondent's family were reluctant to give any help in looking after our child, but the Petitioner has never shown any desire for, or intention of seeking such help from the Respondent's family, and in fact has over many years actively sought to discourage such visits, and to make the Respondent feel selfish and guilty for his visits to his family, an attitude which has been deeply hurtful to the Respondent and damaging to the marriage. </p>

	<p class="petitioner">The Petitioner does not have any close family in the area and has been hurt by the actions of the Respondent's family. When she has tried to talk to the Respondent about this he fails to understand her point of view. The Petitioner feels that she has not support from the Respondent.</p>

	<p class="respondent">As stated above, there have never been any exchanges of views or actions that the Petitioner could reasonably consider hurtful to her, unless the simple act of not sending a birthday card could be so considered. The Petitioner has an entrenched and conservative view of what might be considered proper or friendly behaviour which is hardly reasonable by  normal standards. The Respondent's family have always had a relaxed attitude to the giving of gifts and cards, and such omissions would be considered offensive by very few people. The Respondent considers that the Petitioner's dislike of the Respondent's family is borne of baseless fears and unjustified resentments held by the Petitioner.</p>

	<p class="petitioner">(ii) There is an age gap of 12 years between the Petitioner and the Respondent. The Respondent is the eldest in the relationship and the Petitioner feels that he does not regard her as an equal in their partnership. The Respondent does not listen to the client's ideas or opinions and prefers to make his own decisions in everything.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The Respondent acknowledges that the age difference (actually 11 years and two months) is of concern to the Petitioner, but rejects the notion that this has been a significant factor in the breakdown of the relationship.</p>

	<p class="petitioner">(iii) the Respondent is incredibly controlling over financial matters and very secretive about this financial position. The Respondent only permits the Petitioner limited spending from the joint account.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">This is false in all respects. The Petitioner's lack of trust is deep-seated and intractable, and no amount of openness was able to remedy it.</p>

	<p class="respondent">The joint account with the Halifax, principally for food shopping, is a JOINT account to which the Petitioner has always had full access. The Petitioner holds a debit card for the account and has always been free to visit any branch of the Halifax, or set up her own online account, to view the balance of the account or withdraw monies. At no time has the Respondent ever refused to put money into the account, and even when spending on the account has been unusually high the Respondent has always topped up the account on a monthly basis, regardless of how much the Petitioner has spent on it. These circumstances still apply. Requests by the Respondent for the Petitioner to try and save money on the household budget have usually been met with accusations of miserliness, or injunctions to 'get another job'. The most recent of such unhelpful suggestions was that if the Respondent had no more money to spare he should have secured a loan so that he could give the Petitioner money for our child's schooling. </p>

	<p class="respondent">The Petitioner's perceived notion of secrecy is probably a result of the fact that the Respondent changed the password for the online account. This was in direct response to threatening and mischievous behaviour by the Petitioner, including the deletion of addresses and photos on the computer, leading the Respondent to deny the Petitioner online access because that password also gave her access to the Respondent's personal account (the "Loan Account") and the Respondent feared that the Petitioner might maliciously withdraw funds from that account. Although with hindsight that fear was unjustified, it was not an unreasonable concern at the time. Irrespective of this action, the Petitioner has always exhibited mistrust of the Respondent without any justification and cannot substantiate any of the accusations she has made against the Respondent.</p>

	<p class="respondent">Although the Petitioner has been generous when she has had money, such as her legacy and a sum from her late aunt, at times of hardship the Petiitioner's lack of trust has led to a refusal on her part to acknowledge financial difficulty suffered by the Respondent. Far from being secretive and controlling, the Respondent has constantly struggled hard to reduce the household budget to a manageable amount. This  included, over a long period, the Respondent often going without  snacks, chocolate, coffees and hot food on journeys to and from London, and parking an extra distance from Chelmsford station to make use of the cheaper car parks, to try to save money. The Respondent neither drinks, smokes nor gambles and at most times is frugal and prudent,  spending little on himself except when necessary for new clothes for work. </p>

	<p class="respondent">Throughout the term of the marriage the Respondent has always left all financial papers accessible to the Petitioner, either left where they were opened for the Petitioner to see or laid in the study with all other financial papers. These include all payslips, P60s, bank statements (from both joint and personal accounts) and all other documents such as premium bonds. The mortgage account with the Nationwide is held jointly and the Petitioner has exactly the same access rights to it as the Respondent.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The Respondent's financial dealings with the Petitioner have always been, and still are, open-ended, honest and non-restrictive, but this has never been enough to allay the Petitioner's mistrust. The Respondent has never sought to cap any spending on any account held between us. The Respondent has never sought to hide money from the Petitioner, and has never refused it if asked. The Respondent's own current account is always fully used up by the time of the next salary deposit, and the legacy of just over &pound;5,000 from the Respondent's father was deposited in the Loan Account as a cushion to delay the slide towards debt which seemed inevitable if the household budget could not be brought under control. This legacy amount is reducing on a monthly basis and has been doing so since it was received. The Petitioner has never acknowledged nor allowed proper discussion of the financial difficulties suffered by the Respondent, considering that this was solely the Respondent's problem and that her own income was separate and private.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">Contrary to the Petitioner's accusations, it is she who has been secretive and controlling, in 2007 amassing a credit card debt of approx &pound;5,000 without telling the Respondent, a debt which she was unable to pay off and which was increasing monthly. The Respondent increased the mortage amount by &pound;6,000 in order to give financial stability to the Petitioner, but two years later she has again built up a credit card debt of approx &pound;2,500.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">If the Respondent has been inflexible and insensitive in responding to the Petitioner's mistrustful nature, he is sorry and wishes he had been otherwise, but asks for a recognition of the difficult nature of dealing with such persistent and undeserved mistrust.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">When the Petitioner inherited a large sum of money the Respondent made the decision to use this money to discharge the mortgage in part on the property. This was done without consultation with the Petitioner although he did inform her of his intentions.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The transfer of a sum to reduce the mortgage was done with the full knowledge, agreement and approval of the Petitioner, because the Respondent and the Petitioner were both aware that the existing mortgage was in excess of what could be afforded by the household's joint monthly income. The Respondent at no time used any of the Petitioner's legacy without her approval and consent. </p>

	<p class="petitioner">The remainder of the inheritance money was transferred from the joint account by the Respondent and the account closed without the Petitioner's knowledge.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The joint account referred to here was a high-interest account opened with the sole objective of maximising interest from the large sum of money (approx &pound;145,000) from the Petitioner's legacy. At the time of closure the account contained very little money and no longer qualified for higher interest. The Respondent could see no useful purpose in having two joint Halifax accounts and so, not unreasonably, closed the legacy account. At no time was there any act or intention to deceive the Petitioner, and the monies transferred were not spent by the Respondent on anything except month to month running of the household budget. </p>

	<p class="petitioner">The Respondent makes virtually no contribution to the household other than to pay the mortgage and utility bills. The Petitioner has furnished the property entirely and has also paid to add a conservatory. The Petitioner is upset by the lack of trust when it comes to financial matters.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The Respondent pays for, and has always paid for, the mortgage; the ISAs which support the mortgage; council tax; home and contents insurance; tv licence; boiler and central heating insurance; central heating repair bills; shower repairs; all utilities; the Petitioner's RAC cover; all the weekly food. The Respondent reiterates that any lack of trust by the Respondent is in fact a perceived lack and not a real one, and that the Respondent has always been fully open and honest in his financial dealings.</p>

	<p class="petitioner">(iv) The Respondent is constantly moaning to the Petitioner that she books holidays that he cannot afford to pay for, but in reality the Respondent makes no contribution to these holidays whatsoever. On the last occasion that the Respondent accompanied the family on holiday he was moody and resentful and took only &pound;100 towards spending money expecting the Petitioner to fund the remainder.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">The complaint was occasional, not constant. On the holiday in question, to Kefalonia, the Respondent took &pound;100 cash spending money. At no time during the holiday was the Respondent reluctant to pay for anything, and when the Petitioner said she could not afford the Island Tour the Respondent immediately booked it with his credit card. The Respondent was willing at any time to withdraw more money on his debit or credit card if it has been required, and the imputation by the Petitioner that this was not so is unwarranted.</p>

	<p class="petitioner">(v) The Petitioner and Respondent have not engaged in a relationship for some considerable time.</p>
	
	<p class="respondent">More's the pity.</p>
	
	<p class="petitioner">The Petitioner believes that the Respondent's behaviour has caused the breakdown of their marriage.</p>

	<p class="respondent">If the Petitioner is honest and open-minded, she must acknowledge that this is far from the truth. </p>
