  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva" size=+1><b>In the last of her three-part series, <b>Caroline Waldegrave</b> of Leith's School of Food and Wine prepares four classic sauces</b></font></p>

<p>NEVER buy bottled or packet sauce, I tell my students. Bought sauces are expensive, full of unexpected E-numbers and don't taste anything like the home-made variety. A good sauce can be anything from a few juices in a frying-pan to a time-consuming and sophisticated demi-glace but the classic techniques that every cook should know are for flour-thickened sauces and emulsions. All sauces serve four.</p>

<h3>Flour-thickened sauces</h3>

<p>The commonest English sauces - and the most practical for the home cook - are those thickened with flour. The secret is not to add too much flour (which will make them too thick), to beat them well, and to give them a good boil after they have thickened (which will make them shine). They will also look professionally shiny if they are finished by whizzing in a blender, or if they are 'mounted' with a little extra butter, which is gradually incorporated in dice at the end. All flour-thickened sauces - except those with added cheese - will benefit from this treatment.</p>

<p>The butter-and-flour base of a sauce is called a roux. In a white roux the butter and flour are mixed over a gentle heat without browning; in a blond roux, they are allowed to cook to a straw colour; and in a brown roux, they are cooked until gently brown.</p>

<p>If the liquid in a stew or casserole is too thin it can be thickened with the addition of beurre mani&eacute; (a smooth paste made of equal quantities of flour and softened butter kneaded together) whisked into the boiling liquid at the end of the cooking time; as the butter melts, the flour is distributed through the sauce, thickening it without forming lumps. </p>

<p>Cornflour and arrowroot are also useful thickeners. They are 'slaked' (mixed to a paste with cold water, stock or milk), added to a hot liquid and allowed to boil for a couple of minutes to thicken it.</p>

<h3>Emulsions</h3>

<p>Emulsified sauces contain tiny droplets of oil or fat evenly distributed in suspension through the sauce.</p>

<p><b>Stable emulsions</b>: mayonnaise is the best known of the cold stable emulsion sauces, in which oil is beaten into egg yolks and held in suspension.</p>

<p><b>Eggless emulsions</b>: these butter sauces have become very popular. The classic is beurre blanc.</p>

<p><b>Warm emulsions</b>: the most stable warm emulsions are based on egg yolks and butter. The best known is hollandaise.</p>

<p><b>Unstable emulsions</b>: French dressing will emulsify if whizzed or whisked, but will separate into its component parts after about 15 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Mornay sauce</b></p>

<p>This is a variation of a basic white sauce, with the addition of cheese. It accompanies many traditional British recipes such as cauliflower cheese.</p>

<blockquote><li>20g (3/4oz) butter<br>
<li>20g (3/4oz) plain flour<br>
<li>a pinch of English mustard powder<br>
<li>a pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
<li>290ml (1/2 pint) milk<br>
<li>55g (2oz) gruy&egrave;re or strong cheddar, grated<br>
<li>15g (1/2oz) freshly grated parmesan (optional)</blockquote>

<p>Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan and stir in the flour, mustard powder and cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring, for one minute. Remove the pan from the heat. Pour in the milk and mix well. Return the pan to the heat and stir well until boiling. Turn down the heat and simmer, continuing to stir well, for two minutes. Add all the cheese, and mix well, but do not re-boil or the sauce will become stringy. If the sauce gets cold, reheat it with great care, stirring well. Season carefully with salt and pepper. </p>

<p>If you oversalt it, add some cream or cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che.</p>

<p><b>Beurre blanc</b></p>

<p>This delicious sauce goes particularly well with fish, especially poached salmon, and new potatoes.</p>

<blockquote><li>225g (8oz) unsalted butter, chilled<br>
<li>1 tbsp finely chopped shallot <br>
<li>3 tbsp white wine vinegar<br>
<li>3 tbsp water<br>
<li>freshly ground white pepper<br>
<li>a squeeze of lemon juice</blockquote>

<p>Cut the butter into cubes, but keep it chilled. Put the shallot, vinegar and water into a heavy saut&eacute; pan or small shallow saucepan and boil until reduced to about two tablespoons. Strain and return to the saucepan. Lower the heat under the saucepan. Beating vigorously with a wire whisk, gradually add the butter, piece by piece, then season with salt, white pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p>

<p>Do not allow the sauce to boil or it will curdle. (But if it does start to curdle, it can be saved by adding some ice-cold water.) The process should take about five minutes and the sauce will be thick, creamy and pale - rather like a thin hollandaise.</p>

<p><b>Mayonnaise</b></p>

<p>This is an example of how much more delicious home-made sauces can be than those bought in jars. The taste will vary depending on the type of oil used (extra-virgin is too strong for most tastes). This recipe contains raw eggs but, if you prefer, you can use sieved hard-boiled egg yolks. </p>

<blockquote><li>2 egg yolks<br>
<li>1 tsp dry English mustard powder<br>
<li>290ml (1/2 pint) olive oil, or <br>
<li>150ml (1/4 pint) each olive and <br>
<li>sunflower oil, mixed together<br>
<li>a squeeze of lemon juice<br>
<li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</blockquote>

<p>Put the yolks into a bowl with a pinch of salt and the mustard powder and beat well with a wooden spoon. (Place the bowl on a damp cloth to stop it slipping.) Add the olive oil, or mixture of oils, drop by drop, beating all the time. The mixture should be very thick by the time half the oil is added. At this point, stop adding the oil and beat in the lemon juice. Resume pouring in the oil, going more quickly, but alternating the dribbles of oil with small quantities of vinegar. Season to taste.</p>

<p>If the mixture curdles, beat another egg yolk in a separate bowl, and beat the curdled mixture into this drop by drop.</p>

<p><b>Hollandaise sauce</b></p>

<p>This sauce, which appears frequently on restaurant menus, isn't as complicated to make as many people think. A classic way to serve it is with cooked asparagus as a first course in the summer.</p>

<blockquote><li>3 tbsp white wine vinegar<br>
<li>6 black peppercorns<br>
<li>1 bay leaf<br>
<li>2 egg yolks<br>
<li>110g (4oz) softened unsalted butter<br>
<li>lemon juice<br>
<li>freshly ground white pepper</blockquote>

<p>Make a reduction by placing the vinegar, peppercorns and bay leaf in a small heavy saucepan and reducing the liquid by simmering to one tablespoon. Strain and set the liquid aside. With a wooden spoon, beat the yolks with a pinch of salt and a small piece of butter in a small bowl. Place the bowl over a small saucepan of warm water, making sure that the water does not boil. (At Leith's we often make hollandaise by placing the bowl in a small roasting tin half-filled with warm water, setting the tin over a gentle heat with the bowl at the other end away from the direct heat.) </p>

<p>Beat the mixture until slightly thickened. Add a little of the reduction and mix well. Stir over the heat, again until slightly thickened. Beat in teaspoon-sized amounts of softened butter piece by piece, increasing the temperature under the pan of water as the sauce thickens but still taking care that the water does not boil. </p>

<p>When the sauce has become light and thick remove from the heat and beat or whisk for one minute. Taste for seasoning, and add lemon juice, the rest of the reduction, salt and white pepper as necessary. Stand the bowl in warm water until ready to serve. </p>

<p>Hollandaise sauce will set too firmly if allowed to get cold, and it will curdle if overheated.</p>

<p>If you need a large quantity of hollandaise, you can make it in either a liquidiser or food processor. (Simply increase the ingredients proportionally.) Put the egg yolks - a minimum of four in a small food processor - and a pinch of salt into the blender and blend lightly. Add the hot reduction, keeping the machine running so that the mixture thickens slightly. When you are ready to serve, melt the butter and slowly add to the mixture, with the machine running, allowing the sauce to thicken as you pour.</p>
